## Exploratory Analysis of Direct and Indirect Prenatal Smoking Exposure Effects on Children Externalizing Behavior


The primary research goal of this report is to delve into the effects of smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on various aspects of adolescent development, specifically focusing on self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing behaviors. The data for this analysis were sourced from Dr. Lauren Micalizzi of the Brown University Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences. The study initially recruited a cohort of low-income pregnant women, totaling 738 individuals, as part of a smoke avoidance intervention program to reduce maternal smoking and ETS exposure during pregnancy. Furthermore, the study also assessed children's exposure to ETS in the immediate postpartum period. For this research, a subset of 100 adolescents and their mothers was randomly selected for recruitment, forming the core dataset.  
  
The data can be broadly categorized into two sections: child and parent data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the adolescent and parent dynamics. The child section has essential demographic information, including race and sex. Additionally, scores related to attention, internalizing and externalizing problems, and emotion regulation attributes such as Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression. Moreover, the dataset encompasses information on child substance use and the parent-child relationship. The parent section mirrors many of the child's data categories. It also includes additional information such as the child's ADHD status, parental demographic details like income, employment, and education, and data directly related to smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).  
  
Despite the richness of the dataset, it's important to acknowledge certain limitations that may influence the scope and interpretation of the analysis findings. First, cotinine levels, which serve as a biomarker of nicotine exposure, were only measured at two-time points---34 weeks gestation and 6 months after birth. This limitation necessitates a reliance on self-reported data for nicotine exposure in other instances. Second, the data analyzed in this report are limited to baseline measurements for both children and parents. Therefore, this study does not encompass longitudinal analysis, limiting the ability to draw conclusions about changes over time. Finally, this research's inclusion criteria required data for both the parent and child, resulting in a reduced dataset of 49 parent-child pairs. This reduced sample size may impact the generalizability of the findings to a broader population.
