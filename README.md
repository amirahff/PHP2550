## About

This repository is a collection of projects completed for PHP 2550 at Brown University (Fall 2023).  

Project 1 focuses on exploratory data analysis, where we explore the relationship between prenatal smoking and exposure to smoking in relation to children's externalizing behavior.

Project 2 is about building a prediction model. We are developing a model to predict tracheostomy outcomes in babies with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Project 3 deals with simulation, applying transportability analysis from a model built using known source data (Framingham) to a simulated dataset.

Details for each project can be accessed in their respective folders.
